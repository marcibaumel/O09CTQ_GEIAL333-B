### Solid Principals:

    SRP - Single Responsibility Principle.
    One purpose
    
    OCP - Open/Closed Principle.
    Later on you can't change your class, you can extend the original class
    and then refactore it

    LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle.
    If you overrid an existing method, your method must be luzyier(laz√°bb)
    Overriding a method is not good. Implemnetion over extendsen
    
    ISP - Interface Segregation Principle.
    Use interface, you don't know what the code will do    

    DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle.
